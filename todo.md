this is a holding pen for near-future stuff so I don't forget

Backbone stuff:
  upvote buttons for answers
  
  Forms for answers and comments on the questions show page actually work
  Button to pop in the comments form instead of just having a shitload of them

  make comments upvotable

  Edit links that only appear if you own the thing
  Add sessions controller to api and use it to get current user
    Have it return the JSON
    Client-side, turn that into a model
    make it like BlockOverhead.currentUser

  Sorting questions  
  Styles!
