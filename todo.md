this is a holding pen for near-future stuff so I don't forget

Backbone stuff:
  hopeful schedule ahaha

  add a cancel button to edit forms (duh)
  make joindate timestamps not dumb

  set up a second search that uses prefix so the in-page tags search is better

  pagination
  update pagination for users/tags when the search updates
    make like a build pagenav function and do it that way
    instead of having it in the template?
  Sorting questions

  FRI:
  Update index item templates to have a little more information
  Styles!
