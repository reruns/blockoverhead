this is a holding pen for near-future stuff so I don't forget

Backbone stuff:
  add a cancel button to edit forms (duh)
  put the upload from URL behavior on the avatar form
  Sorting questions
  limit the number of things that appear in the questions and answers sections of the user show page

  FRI:
  Update index item templates to have a little more information
  Styles!
