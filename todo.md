this is a holding pen for near-future stuff so I don't forget

Backbone stuff:
  add a cancel button to edit forms (duh)
  make joindate timestamps not dumb

  Sorting questions

  limit the number of things that appear in the questions and answers sections of the user show page

  FRI:
  Update index item templates to have a little more information
  Styles!
