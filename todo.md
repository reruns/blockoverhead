this is a holding pen for near-future stuff so I don't forget

Backbone stuff:
  Question and User show pages filled out with info
  Forms for answers and comments on the questions show page
  Button to pop in the comments form instead of just having a shitload of them
  Users page lists user's answers and comments
  Unanswered questions
  Sort tabs for the questions index view
